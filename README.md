# Simple-Contact-Tracing

#### A contact tracing web application for the Department of Computer Engineering of the University of San Carlos. Everyone (student, faculty, guest, and other visitors) must use the app before coming in and out the office. Information such as ID number, name, address, contact number, and email must be inputted by the user. The admin can search user according to their names, barangay, city, or province, and can also retrieve users according to the time and day they enter the office.

This was coded using PHP and MySQL as its database. This was a group project and I was in charge for the log in feature of the web app.
